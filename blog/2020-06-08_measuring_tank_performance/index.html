in their thinking. Getting ammoracked by a Death Star will raise suspicion that
the Death Star is an OP tank even though it is actually the worst tier X
tank. Anecdotal experiences distort opinions and no one remembers those
countless battles where a Death Star was at the bottom of the list.
Therefore, tank performance is not a thing that we should vote about,
but a thing we can measure with statistics.</p><h2 id=how-to-measure-performance-in-the-game>How to measure performance in the game?</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s discuss first how to measure performance in the game. I am a proponent of
<strong>win rate being the best measure for performance</strong> (player or tank) - not
average damage, not average kills, and not speed, not alpha damage or any
other attribute or characteristics. The reason for choosing win rate over
other variables is the fact that <strong>winning is the objective of the game</strong>
and all the damage, kills, spotting etc. are just means to win the game.
Why measure proxy variables when you can measure the final variable itself?</p><p>There are some caveats in using WR as a performance measure:</p><ol><li>It requires <em>many</em> battles for the WR to settle near one&rsquo;s performance level due to
both MM and RNG: It takes 400 battles to reach +/- 5% accuracy, 10000 battles to
reach +/- 1% accuracy and whopping 1 million battles to reach 0.1% accuracy with
95% confidence level. <a href=http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/357838-winrate-for-mathematicians-a-quantitative-analysis/ target=_blank>Check this link at PC WoT forums for details</a>.</li><li>Platoon rate impacts on WR but cannot be separated well from the statistics
since WG does not publish platoon rate per tank played, but just as a aggregate
level over all the tanks. Platooning with a good player can lift one&rsquo;s WR 5-15%.</li><li>Career WR measures historical average, not one&rsquo;s present performance level,
and it reacts slowly once the player has lot (10k+) battles.</li><li>WG&rsquo;s new &ldquo;newbie MM queue&rdquo; has distorted the Career stats for rerollers
big time. This distorts both tank and player average WR. (Just ignore global & career WR).</li><li>Some tanks are more powerful than others. Comparing different players&rsquo;
WR in different tanks or global WR does not tell us much.</li><li>Different tiers have different level of difficulty. Global / Average WR is
close to useless for measuring player / tank performance.</li><li>Stock tanks&rsquo; performance is significantly lower compared to when maxed-out.</li></ol><p>But other performance measures have issues too and can be gamed; Easiest way to
increase average damage is to play more high tiers and more TDs, WN8 can be gamed
by playing popular tech three tanks that are difficult for below average players
and not too popular among the unicums.</p><p>Despite all the issues related to WR, I consider it the best performance measure
over a large number of battles and in case of tanks, over large number of players
since it measures directly the objective of the game (=to win battles). It is also
a more understandable measure vs. somewhat abstract indexes. But I believe
performance indicators like WN8 which are based on <em>input stats</em> (average damage, kills, spots)
give a more accurate view of players&rsquo; short-term performance (&lt; 100 battles) than WR.</p><p>Now going back to the tank performance.</p><h2 id=so-average-wr-it-is-then-right>So Average WR it is then, right?</h2><p><em>Not so fast.</em> Average WR of a tank is a good starter, but it has its own biases.
Let&rsquo;s have a look at two tier IX mediums: <em>AMX 30 1er prototype</em> and <em>Prototipo Standard B</em>.
Everything here is based on 6.9 data.</p><p><a href=#image-5cc00c48c4a4b4fff4ec9e9d87146d69 class=lightbox-link><img src=figure/fig_Tank_WR-1.svg.gz alt="plot of chunk fig_Tank_WR" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

Platooning has been ignored here since unfortunately WG does not publish very usable
platooning stats via their <a href=https://developers.wargaming.net/ target=_blank>API</a>.</p><p>Saying &ldquo;any tank is OP in good players hands&rdquo; is the same as saying &ldquo;any car
is fast in the hands of a good driver&rdquo;. While a good driver can make better-than-average
lap times with a slow car, a good driver does not make the car any faster, but is
just &mldr; a good driver. Give the driver a faster car and they can drive even faster.</p><p><strong>TL;DR.

compare the playerbases. I have chosen <em>player average WR at the tier</em> as
a measure for &ldquo;player skill&rdquo;. And more precisely as measured during the
update under study (i.e. not career WR). This eliminates couple of biases:</p><ul><li>WR during the update measures the player&rsquo;s current performance unlike
Career WR that measures the average historical performance
(re-rollers vs. normal players)</li><li>It measures player performance at the tier in question unlike average
WR over all the tiers, and thus is not distorted by low-tier stats-padding</li></ul><p>The plot below shows player WR distribution at tier IX (in any tank) for the
both AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B players. It is clear that the AMX 30
1er prototype is played by better players than Standard B. Stock tank battles
(Standard B) have been filtered out based on an estimate of battles required to
max-out the tank (139).</p><p><a href=#image-28e62a7ee8e8df3f040e17a52dbccfa3 class=lightbox-link><img src=figure/fig_player_WR_histogram-1.svg.gz alt="plot of chunk fig_player_WR_histogram" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

Average WR differences or not?</p><h2 id=introducing-relative-wr>Introducing Relative WR</h2><p>To separate the players&rsquo; skill-level distribution from tank performance, we need
to compare players&rsquo; WR in a tank to their skill-level. As explained above, I have
chosen <em>Average WR at the Tier</em> as the measure for player skill.
<a href=https://tank-compare.blitzstars.com/ target=_blank>Blitzstars&rsquo; Tank-Compare</a> uses players&rsquo;
average WR (on any tier) as a measure for player skill in its Relative WR graphs.
I have chose to use the WR at the tier in question to eliminate the impact of
low-tier stat padding.</p><p><em>Relative WR(tank) = Average(WR in a tank - Player&rsquo;s WR at the Tier)</em></p><p>In a nutshell, <strong>Relative WR shows how much more/less the players are winning with the tank vs. their tier average</strong>.
The higher the Relative WR, the stronger the tank is.</p><p><a href=#image-f4f0634e3d8a0bf9ceb6cde072f2d59c class=lightbox-link><img src=figure/fig_relativeWR_avg-1.svg.gz alt="plot of chunk fig_relativeWR_avg" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

with Standard B than the AMX when compared to their tier IX average.
The AMX&rsquo;s average WR is far higher than the Standard B&rsquo;s, but its
playerbase is far better too - on average. when the differences in
the playerbase are taken into account, the difference becomes small
and to the Standard B&rsquo;s advantage. <strong>The difference IS statistically significant</strong>
See significance testing below.</p><p>Premium tanks and new higher tier tank lines are often played by better
players than average. This distorts the average WR of those tanks and
makes people regard the tanks as OP whereas the fundamental reason can
be that the tanks are just being played by better players. Yes, there
are many borderline-OP & ridiculously-broken premium tanks, but the
Relative WR analysis allows us to separate tank performance from skill-level
differences in the tanks&rsquo; playerbases.</p><div class=expand><input type=checkbox id=expand-242a6bc4deb678d2573b00a7e7bdcd8f aria-controls=expandcontent-242a6bc4deb678d2573b00a7e7bdcd8f>

Even though average WR is such a common measure for tanks&rsquo; performance,
it fails to separate the impact of the different
playerbases from the underlying tank performance. And even when comparing
tank&rsquo;s (average) Relative WR it only answers to the question <em>in average</em> -
not for very good player or well-below average player.</p><p>To understand how does a tank perform in the hands of certain skill-level players,
the Relative WR analysis can still come handy as it can be run for a specific skill-level
players only. Again, the numbers are averages and there are always players who are
relatively better on one tank vs other. But the Relative WR analysis per skill-level
can help a player to choose tanks they are more likely to perform better with.</p><p>In case of the AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B, the differences between the
tank performance are mostly insignificant, but not far from being statistically
significant. As anyone skilled player who has played those, both the tanks are good.
I would call it a draw here since there are far larger imbalances in the game.</p><p>The graph below shows Relative WR for both the tanks as a function of players&rsquo;
average WR at the tier (IX). The grey area shows the share of players with
particular WR at the tier in the data set. Small sample sizes are likely to
cause errors in both the ends of the graph.</p><p><a href=#image-70debd606b7cf4c9b2eae7ce7a3afc8d class=lightbox-link><img src=figure/fig_player_RelativeWR-1.svg.gz alt="plot of chunk fig_player_RelativeWR" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

The absolute differences are not that big and this could go into statistical error tolerances. What may explain the result is the fact that player skill follows broadly normal distribution, thus there are more players with (tier) WR closer to 50% than further away from it. Therefore the 60-70% WR player segment consist of mostly 60-65% players vs. 65-70% players. And there is quite a difference skill still between 60-65% and 70%+ players as I can observe every time I watch e.g. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXlz_YO1yM2JBVFi7g727A target=_blank>Juicy Tender Steak</a> or <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-Dy8lVsm11u8pCJ8W7Tw target=_blank>HisRoyalFatness</a> playing tanks.</p><p><em>That&rsquo;s all folks - this time</em></p><footer class=footline><div id=footer style=text-align:center;margin:20px><ul class=banners><li class=cc><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><p>This work is licensed under a <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
