That’s is a big number so let’s have a look on the player base.
Career WR The chart below shows player’s career WR over those 1M players. The career WR distribution seems almost normal distribution, but only almost. The right-hand side “tail” is reaching further from the mean vs. the left-hand side and the mean WR is above 50%. This seems impossible. This is likely related to the sampling of the players, since more active players are more likely to end up in the the database. Many players (38%) have given up the game or at least have not played in 2021. It seems the the success of the player does not influence on the decision to give up on the game - at least among those who have ended into the database.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-02-27_1m_accounts/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
