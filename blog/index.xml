Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats
right after &amp;ldquo;the Matchmaker&amp;rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &amp;ldquo;OP&amp;rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics.</description></item><item><title>Update 6.10 stats added</title><link>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2020-06-17_update_6.10_stats_added/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2020-06-17_update_6.10_stats_added/</guid><description>Stats for update 6.10 has been added to the site.

The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes.</description></item><item><title>Update 7.7 final stats added</title><link>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-03-26_7.7_final_stats_added/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-03-26_7.7_final_stats_added/</guid><description>Final stats for update 7.7 have been added.
