In a Measuring tank performance, part I I showed how tanks’ player bases differ from each other and why thus Average WR is a poor measure for comparing tanks’ performance. Have a look at the differences among the Tiger II and Somua SM players’ WR at tier VIII stats. There is over 8% difference between the tanks’ players average WR at tier VIII. That is huge difference and therefore it’s clear the average WR of
Somua SM is far higher than that of Tiger II.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-08-29_measuring_tank_performance_2/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
