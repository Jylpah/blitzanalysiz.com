Tank-specific pages have been added to the site (E 100). The pages show detailed analysis of each tier V-X tank.

It tells how well the tank is performing for different skill-level players relative to the other players’ other same tier tanks.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2020-08-14_tank_pages_added/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
