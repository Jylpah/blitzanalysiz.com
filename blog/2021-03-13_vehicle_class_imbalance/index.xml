The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes. This results mirrored teams causing monotonic battles. In my view, most of the vehicle class matching rules should be abolished, but I know well how I am in the minority here.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-03-13_vehicle_class_imbalance/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
