In total, there were 107M battles by 400k players recorded in the database during the update 8.2.
The TOP20 best performing tanks list has not significant changes. Annihilator was nerfed via MM in update 8.1 and it has since dropped from the list. It is still insanely powerful tank, but meets always another Anni in the red team so easy farming days in completely broken tank are over. Crocodileâ€™s tears from me, boys.</description></item></channel></rss>
